# Selah 🕊️ *(Tentative)*

> A Duolingo-inspired Bible learning and spiritual growth application focused on consistency, understanding, and habit formation.

## 📖 Overview

**Selah** *(tentative name)* is a Bible learning and study application designed to help Christians build a consistent habit of reading, understanding, and applying Scripture. Inspired by the gamified learning model of Duolingo, the app combines structured Bible reading plans, short lessons, quizzes, streaks, and progress tracking to encourage daily engagement with God’s Word.

This project is intentionally built incrementally to support daily development and continuous improvement.
