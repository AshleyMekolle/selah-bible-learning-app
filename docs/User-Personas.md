- **Tech Savviness:** High (daily smartphone user, uses multiple apps)
- **Faith Background:** Grew up Christian, active in church, wants to deepen personal faith

### Profile
Sarah loves God and wants to grow spiritually, but her busy work schedule and social life make consistency challenging.

### Profile
David has recently returned to church after years away from faith. He feels like he's starting from scratch and is overwhelmed by how much he doesn't remember or understand. He's analytical by nature and wants to truly comprehend what he's reading, not just go through the motions.

## Anti-Persona: Mark - The Theological Scholar

### Profile
Mark is pursuing a seminary degree and needs advanced exegetical tools, original language analysis, and comprehensive commentaries. He's looking for deep academic study resources.

### Why Not Our Target
Selah is designed for habit formation and consistent engagement, not academic research. Mark needs software like Logos, Accordance, or BibleWorks. Building features for Mark would detract from the core mission of helping everyday believers build consistency.

## Persona Priority for MVP

1. **Sarah** (Primary) - 70% of feature decisions
2. **David** (Secondary) - 20% of feature decisions
3. **Grace** (Tertiary) - 10% of feature decisions

The MVP will focus primarily on Sarah's needs, with consideration for David where it doesn't add complexity. Grace's needs will inform accessibility decisions but won't drive core features initially.
